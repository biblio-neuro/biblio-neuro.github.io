Identify high-yield anatomic regions suitable for cadaveric review2.	Work with industry to arrange for cadaveric labs that are anatomy site specific3.	Develop pre-lab surveys/quizzes, intra-lab observation, and post-lab surveys that quantify resident comprehension and acquisitiona.	Simple, repeatable, 3-5 objectives per lab per level, with good intra-observer reliabilityb.	Would require active participation by faculty sponsor during labc.	Objectives do not necessarily suggest participation in lab but competencies to be evaluated4.	Labs are on a repeating/rotating q2-3 year schedule a.	Allows for evaluation of residents at varying levels of training i.	Beginner: PGY1-2ii.	Intermediate: PGY 3-4iii.	Advanced: PGY 5-6b.	Chiefs (PGY-7) would be partly responsible for intra-lab evaluations, thus completing cycle of education/mastery5.	Based on 4-6 labs per year (once every 2-3 months)Rationale:1.	Orthopedics residency already requires cadaveric dissections as part of curriculum2.	Cadaveric studies are useful adjunct in surgical training3.	Allows for semi-quantifiable educational experience4.	Also fosters industry partnershipsThe types of labs are typically spine and skull base.","Residents must not be scheduled for more than six consecutive nights of night float.

Maximum In-House On-Call Freq PGY-2 residents and above must be scheduled for in-house call no more frequently than every-third-night (when averaged over a four-week period).

At-Home Call

Time spent in the hospital by residents on at-home call must count towards the 80-hour maximum weekly hour limit. The frequency of at-home call is not subject to the every-third-night limitation, but must satisfy the requirement for one-day-in-seven free of duty, when averaged over four weeks.

(1) At-home call must not be as frequent or taxing as to preclude rest or reasonable personal time for each resident.

(2) Residents are permitted to return to the hospital while on at-home call to care for new or established patients. Each episode of this type of care, while it must be included in the 80-hour weekly maximum, will not initiate a new ?off-duty period?.","Resident Research

The resident is expected to undertake substantive research resulting?as a minimum?in publishing one report in a peer-reviewed basic science journal, and making one podium presentation at a significant national neurosurgical meeting.

The resident also is expected to attend all neurosurgical educational conferences.

A year dedicated to basic science or clinical research provides a unique opportunity for learning, investigation and analysis in a neurosurgical concentration and related disciplines.

Under her supervision, residents get training in translational and regenerative medicine, with hands-on training in laboratory research.

Ongoing projects represent a broad range of clinical questions in neurosurgery, with a focus on surgical outcomes and risk factor stratification. Frailty is one of the innovative areas of ongoing investigation along with strategies for avoidance in TBI, neuro-oncology, cerebrovascular and spinal surgery and neurocritical care. There is also a focus on clinical outcomes of SAH and AIS, as well as the development of practice guidelines in the rapidly evolving field of neuroendovascular surgery. Our research endeavors have expanded from investigator-initiated protocols, to include sponsored research as well. We are currently involved in 5 clinical trials. This includes a DOD-funded feasibility study to assess the use of cerebral blood flow velocity morphology for quantification of intracranial pressure.
